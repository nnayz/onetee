Test Summary for OneTee Backend

This file provides an overview of the test coverage and what's working.

PASSING TESTS (32 total):
=======================

Basic API Tests (10 tests):
- Welcome endpoint
- API documentation availability
- OpenAPI schema availability
- Health check endpoint
- Router inclusion tests
- Invalid endpoint handling
- HTTP method validation

Security Tests (6 tests):
- Password hashing and verification
- JWT token creation and decoding
- Input validation (email, username, password)

Auth Tests (5 tests):
- Auth endpoints existence
- Input validation (invalid email, weak password, short username)

Community Tests (4 tests):
- Community endpoints existence
- Thread creation validation
- Comments endpoint structure
- Hashtags endpoint

Marketplace Tests (4 tests):
- Marketplace endpoints existence
- Products endpoint structure
- Admin endpoints existence
- Categories endpoint

Main API Tests (3 tests):
- Welcome endpoint
- API documentation
- Health check

FAILING TESTS (19 total):
========================

Database Connection Issues (4 tests):
- Auth signup/login tests failing due to PostgreSQL connection
- These need a test database or mocking

Authentication Required (6 tests):
- Community endpoints requiring authentication
- These need proper auth setup for testing

Missing Endpoints (6 tests):
- Some marketplace and community endpoints don't exist yet
- These will pass as you implement the endpoints

Mock Issues (3 tests):
- Some service function mocks need adjustment
- These need proper mocking setup

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Set up test database or mock database connections
2. Implement missing endpoints
3. Add proper authentication for tests
4. Fix mock configurations

The test suite is now comprehensive and will help ensure code quality as you develop!
